# Webcam eye tracker
 
**Important:** This was created as a test/proof-of-concept. It should not be used for production purposes directly.

End-to-end deep learning project using PyTorch to create a PC eye tracker purely from webcam data (i.e., no infrared cameras)

Walkthrough of the code can be found in my blog series here: <https://www.simonho.ca/machine-learning/webcam-eye-tracker-overview>

**Note:** If you're getting low accuracy when running the scripts, it's because the model weights provided in this repo were trained using my own image data. To get usable accuracy in your own projects you will need to collect your own dataset and retrain the model.
